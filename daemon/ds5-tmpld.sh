# Respawn the DS5 raw-ACL transport forwarder (root) + low-priority watchdog for
# the jail-tmp-remount dropout (see history). Plus: drop ds5_txd off REAL-TIME
# scheduling.
#
# Why the priority drop (2026-06-21): ds5_txd self-sets SCHED_FIFO prio 14 for
# all its threads. Its HCI-monitor thread wakes on every BT packet (~420/s) and,
# at RT prio, PREEMPTS the CTM app's usbip input-handling thread -> the streamed
# DS5 input gets polled late -> input "aussetzer". The old SDL input path had no
# such RT daemon and was smooth; severity scaled with ds5_txd's RT load (old=
# slight, self-heal-binary=severe) -> RT preemption is the fingerprint. Running
# ds5_txd at NORMAL priority lets it interleave with (not preempt) the input
# thread; injection is only ~94/s and the BT controller meters output to ~10ms,
# so haptic stays smooth. Revert = delete the chrt loop.

# Singleton guard. The boot hook's start-stop-daemon --exec check can NEVER dedup
# a shell script (busybox matches --exec against /proc/<pid>/exe, which for a
# running script is the INTERPRETER /bin/sh -> busybox, never the script path), so
# a hook re-run (manual start, hbchannel restart, webosbrew re-elevation) would
# spawn a second supervisor + ds5_txd, and the pair would unlink-steal the
# rendezvous sockets from each other on every remount. Guard here instead.
#
# Acquisition is ATOMIC (noclobber create): a plain read-check-write had a
# TOCTOU hole — two simultaneous starts both saw no live owner and both wrote
# the pidfile, i.e. exactly the dual-supervisor failure this guard exists to
# stop. A stale file (crash leftover, recycled pid) is CLAIMED by rename first:
# mv is atomic, so of several racers exactly one removes it; the rest re-loop
# and either lose the create (and find the winner live) or exit.
#
# Liveness anchors on the process IDENTITY, not just cmdline bytes: a recycled
# pid whose cmdline merely mentions the name (vi/tail/grep on this file) must
# not count as a supervisor, or a crash could never be recovered from. A real
# supervisor is the script exec'd directly (the kernel sets comm to the script
# basename for a shebang exec) or a shell interpreting it.

# Take ds5_txd off real-time AND split priorities so neither thread hurts the
# CTM usbip input thread, while keeping haptic tight:
#   main (inject loop, ~94/s): SCHED_OTHER nice -5 -> responsive, tight 0x36 on-air
#     timing, but normal policy so it never preempts the input thread.
#   other threads (HCI-monitor capture wakes ~420/s): SCHED_OTHER nice 19 -> yields
#     to the input thread so it stops nibbling input poll latency.
#
# 2026-06-22 (V5, audit wf_3b16cc9b): MEASURED in-jail during live Ratchet — the CTM
# input/session threads run at nice -20 (the aurora app's ctl_set_rt_prio()
# setpriority(-20) fallback SUCCEEDS; the jail grants CAP_SYS_NICE for nice even
# though it denies SCHED_FIFO). So inject at -5 sits BELOW input (-20) = input wins,
# no cross-process preemption. The earlier "inject -5 out-prioritizes input" concern
# was refuted on this hardware; -5 is correct and kept (still under input).
#
# main is deniced ONCE (denice_main): `renice -n` is RELATIVE on busybox/toybox, so
# re-running `renice -n -5` would drive -5 -> -10 -> -15 -> -20 and TIE the input
# thread (reintroducing the aussetzer). The main thread always exists at startup, so
# one call is correct. Workers are re-asserted (reassert_workers): they may not be
# visible at the first pass (created just after the socket binds), and nice clamps at
# +19 so relative-renice cannot compound them.
