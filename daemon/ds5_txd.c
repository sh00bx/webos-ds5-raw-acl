// ds5_txd.c — root DS5 raw-ACL transport forwarder for the jailed Aurora app.
//
// The webOS app jail lets the app BIND an HCI_CHANNEL_RAW socket but DENIES the
// ACL write() (EPERM), so in-process raw-ACL injection is impossible. This root
// daemon performs the privileged work the app cannot:
//   1. Captures the on-air ACL template (conn handle + dest L2CAP CID) via
//      HCI_CHANNEL_MONITOR (works as root) from our own outgoing HID-output.
//   2. Publishes a readiness/template record into the jail-shared tmp file so the
//      app knows when to stop seeding via hidraw and start forwarding.
//   3. Receives each already-built, already-CRC-signed report from the app over a
//      local AF_UNIX SOCK_DGRAM socket and injects it as a raw HCI ACL packet
//      (root write is permitted) — bypassing webOS BT one-outstanding metering.
//
// IPC is one local datagram per report (~tens of microseconds, no buffering, no
// round trip) — far below the ~10ms audio grid. The app falls back to its normal
// hidraw write if the daemon is absent, so this never regresses.
//
// MULTI-CONTROLLER (2026-07-09) — co-op haptics parity for a 2nd DualSense:
//   The single controller the daemon tracked was defence (e) below; a 2nd DS5's
//   output fell back to the flow-controlled hidraw path (jittery). The state is
//   now an ARRAY of independent inject links (struct ds5_link g_links[MAX_LINKS]),
//   each with its OWN captured template, identity binding, credit window, tx-type
//   ring, audio FIFO and gap telemetry — so every pad gets the same raw-ACL
//   jitter-bypass. Routing:
//     * Inbound reports: the app may TAG a datagram with the target BT address
//       ([0xA5][0x5A][addr LSB-first][report]); the daemon injects it onto the
//       link bound to that address. An UNTAGGED datagram (legacy / single-pad /
//       USB) routes to the PRIMARY link (g_links[0]) — byte-for-byte the old path.
//     * Capture: HID-output seen on a NEW handle binds a FREE link slot (was:
//       "ignore any other handle"). Beyond MAX_LINKS slots a further device is
//       ignored (never flip-flops a bound link).
//     * Readiness: the base template file still tracks the primary link (a 1-pad /
//       untagged app reads it unchanged); each bound link ALSO publishes a
//       per-address file <tmpl>.<aabbccddeeff> that the tagged app polls.
//   Cross-controller resources that are physically shared stay shared: the one
//   radio's scan state (off while ANY link is bound), the HCI command path
//   (rate-limited), and the handle->bdaddr table.
//
// HID-FD BROKER (Option A — app becomes jail-node-independent):
//   The jail's /dev/hidraw* is a STATIC snapshot taken at jail-build (copynodall),
//   so a controller hot-plugged afterwards onto a hidraw minor the snapshot never
//   covered (e.g. /dev/hidraw5) simply does not exist inside the jail — the app's
//   open() returns ENOENT and the bridge dies. We (root, real /dev) open the node
//   the app names and hand the OPEN FD across the jail via SCM_RIGHTS over a second
//   AF_UNIX SOCK_STREAM socket. The app then holds a real kernel fd and every
//   read/write/ioctl works unchanged. Only used as a fallback when the app's own
//   open() fails, so the static-node path is untouched (no regression).
//
//   usage: ds5_txd [sock_path] [tmpl_path] [hidfd_sock_path]
//
// ALT-LATCH HARDENING (2026-06-27, review wf_a75a6ae7) — see ALTLATCH_AUDIT.md:
//   Identity-bind each inject template to the DS5 bdaddr and refuse to inject onto a
//   handle we cannot prove is the DS5, so a flapped+reused 12-bit ACL handle can no
//   longer carry our HID-output onto a foreign device (the Magic-Remote Left-Alt
//   latch). Defences, in layers:
//     (a) Fail CLOSED: a template is published VALID only once the bound handle's
//         bdaddr is known (learned from HCI events or HCIGETCONNLIST). Until then the
//         app keeps seeding via hidraw — safe, never blind-injects.
//     (b) Event-driven invalidation: DISCONN / reassign-to-different-bdaddr of a
//         bound handle drops THAT link's template instantly (covers BR/EDR + legacy
//         & enhanced LE connect events).
//     (c) Idle backstop: evaluated every monitor wakeup (not only on recv-timeout),
//         so it still fires under continuous unrelated BT traffic — a DS5 going
//         silent after a flap invalidates its link within IDLE_INVALIDATE_MS even if
//         the DISCONN event was dropped.
//     (d) Atomic check-and-inject: the bdaddr re-check and the write() happen under
//         one lock, closing the check->inject TOCTOU.
//     (e) Bounded-controller scope: only hci_dev=0 (the inject target) is tracked,
//         so a second ADAPTER's handle reuse can't pollute the table. (This is the
//         controller/adapter index gate — NOT a one-DualSense limit; up to
//         MAX_LINKS DualSenses on hci0 are tracked, each identity-bound.)
//   Plus hardening the two IPC surfaces the audit named: the report datagram socket
//   now requires SO_PEERCRED == jail uid, and the hid-fd broker only ever hands out
//   an allowlisted game pad's hidraw (PAD_ALLOW; DS5, DS4, Xbox, Switch Pro,
//   8BitDo), never a system HID device's node.

 *                          bound but the app has not yet noticed.
 * An old app that only sends 0x5A keeps working (its asserts inject once bound —

 * CONN_COMPLETE to learn handle->bdaddr from and webOS's HCIGETCONNLIST returns
 * an EMPTY list (the vendor stack keeps connections out of the kernel's
 * accounting), so every link stayed fail-closed and the app ran the whole
 * session on the slow hidraw fallback ("restart latency"). The app now
 * DUAL-SENDS while a pad is not ready: each report goes to hidraw (seeding, as
 * before) AND as a tagged datagram asserting "these exact bytes belong to
 * bdaddr X". When the capture thread then sees a DS5 HID-output (0xA2 +
 * 0x31/0x32/0x36 — content-proven DualSense) on an UNKNOWN handle whose bytes
 * exactly match a recent assertion (incl. the app's CRC32 tail + seq nibble),
 * that handle is bound to the asserted address. The sender is SO_PEERCRED-gated
 * to the jail uid, and identical bytes asserted for TWO different addresses are
 * ambiguous -> no learn (wait for diverging content). Defences (a)-(e) hold: we
 * still never inject onto a handle we cannot tie to a specific DualSense.
 * Ring is g_lock-guarded (written by the inject thread, matched by capture). */

 * The window is TYPE-AWARE, derived from rep[0]:

 *                        under contention and a rumble state change (e.g. the
 *                        OFF after a burst) is dropped for as long as the
 *                        contention lasts: the pad keeps buzzing with the last
 *                        applied intensity.
 *   rumble (0x31/0x32):  bounded by the full window AND by its OWN in-flight
 *                        count (rumble_fly) at maxq/2 — counting rumble by
 *                        its own occupancy, not the total, is what makes the
 *                        "rumble may only fill half the window" contract real.
 *
 * Stall backstop: window full with no NOCP for STALL_RESET_MS means the credits
 * are presumed lost (a flap ate the NOCPs) -> resync to empty AND RE-ARM
 * last_nocp. Without the re-arm a long radio blackout (NOCPs delayed, not
 * lost) keeps the stall condition true, so the window would reset every time it
 * refills (~130ms at audio rate) — i.e. unbounded injection into the controller
 * TX queue for the whole blackout, exactly the input-poll starvation the window
 * exists to prevent. Any BLOCKED caller may resync — audio at a full window,
 * rumble also when pinned at its own rcap: the stale-NOCP condition already
 * proves the whole LINK's credits stopped (were audio still flowing, its NOCPs
 * would keep last_nocp fresh), so this never zeroes accounting that is actually
 * live. Without the rumble trigger a rumble-only session (no 0x36 stream to hit
 * the window-full path) stayed wedged after a NOCP loss until the 1.5s idle
 * backstop rebound the link.
 *
 * `expect` (may be NULL) is the target bdaddr the caller ROUTED to (a tagged send).
 * The link is resolved by address, then g_lock is dropped and re-taken here, so a
 * capture-thread rebind of this slot to a DIFFERENT DualSense could slip into that
 * window; re-checking L->bound_addr against `expect` under THIS lock closes it — a
 * mismatch means the slot moved, so we skip (return -2) rather than buzz the wrong
 * pad. NULL (legacy untagged -> primary link) skips the check, unchanged.

 * faster than that for long enough and the socket sndbuf overflows (~30min at

 * late (the night's "firmware wedge" + "dropouts got worse", both really this
 * arithmetic). The command path is SHARED across links (one adapter). Rules:

 *      and the reconcilers simply retry later — the sndbuf can never build more
 *      than ~CMD_PEND_MAX*2s of backlog no matter how hard the session flaps.
 *  (b) every sent command is queued with its timestamp and watched for a
 *      Command Complete on the MONITOR socket (sees responses even in
 *      user-channel mode). The no-response deadline SCALES with the queue
 *      depth we created ourselves — N unacked commands legitimately take
 *      ~2N s to drain, so a fixed deadline false-tripped on a mere flap
 *      burst — miss = cease commands and enter the DEAD state;
 *  (c) EAGAIN on a command write (= sndbuf already full) trips immediately;
 *  (d) DEAD is no longer terminal: every 60s ONE probe command is sent past
 *      the gate; a monitor-observed Command Complete for it clears the state
 *      (logged CMDRECOVER). A foreign completion of the same opcode inside
